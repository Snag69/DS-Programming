# Reflection - Anh Quân

## I. Difficulties Encountered
- Difficulty in linking columns to address the questions.
- The author has collected a large number of columns, which made it challenging to focus on the relevant ones.

## II. Lessons Learned
- Learned how to ask meaningful and relevant questions.
- Gained experience in preprocessing and identifying sources for collecting datasets for study and work.
- Learned how to link columns effectively to derive meaningful insights and answer questions.

## III. Future Improvements (If I Had More Time)
- Reselect a dataset with more meaningful and focused columns.
- With additional time, I would ask more targeted and insightful questions.
